Calculating points  -

No meat or dairy at all for one day.

base points = 0.031415926536

Eating meat or dairy once on one day.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 1.5 = 0.02094395102

Eating meat or dairy twice in one day.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 3 = 0.01047197551

Eating meat or dairy three times in one day.

base points = 0.00

Fasting for a whole day. (maximum of 3 fasting days per week)

base points = 0.031415926536 * 3 = 0.09424777960

No meat or dairy at all for 7 days.

base points = 0.031415926536 * 7 = .021991148575

Eating meat or dairy once per day for 7 days.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 1.5 = 0.02094395102 * 7 = 0.14660765716

Eating meat or dairy twice per day for 7 days.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 3 = 0.01047197551 * 7 = 0.07330382858

Eating meat or dairy three times per day for 7 days.

base points = 0.00

example: no meat or dairy for the week and fasting for 3 days.

fasting points = 0.031415926536 * 3 =   0.09424777960   * 3 = 0.28274333882

Plus the base points from each of the remaining four days of the week for not eating meat or dairy.

0.031415926536 * 4 = 0.12566370614 +  0.28274333882   = 0.40840704496
