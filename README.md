Section 1 - Eating less meat and dairy

Eating less meat and dairy is the greatest deed that anyone can do to help Earth and all life on Earth.

Points will be aggregated every day, every 7 days, every 28 days, and every 365 days.

Calculating points  -

No meat or dairy at all for one day.

base points = 0.031415926536

Eating meat or dairy once on one day.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 1.5 = 0.02094395102

Eating meat or dairy twice in one day.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 3 = 0.01047197551

Eating meat or dairy three times in one day.

base points = 0.00

Fasting for a whole day. (maximum of 3 fasting days per week)

base points = 0.031415926536 * 3 = 0.09424777960

No meat or dairy at all for 7 days.

base points = 0.031415926536 * 7 = .021991148575

Eating meat or dairy once per day for 7 days.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 1.5 = 0.02094395102 * 7 = 0.14660765716

Eating meat or dairy twice per day for 7 days.

base points = 0.031415926536 / 3 = 0.01047197551 * 7 = 0.07330382858

Eating meat or dairy three times per day for 7 days.

base points = 0.00

example: no meat or dairy for the week and fasting for 3 days.

fasting points = 0.031415926536 * 3 =   0.09424777960   * 3 = 0.28274333882

Plus the base points from each of the remaining four days of the week for not eating meat or dairy.

0.031415926536 * 4 = 0.12566370614 +  0.28274333882   = 0.40840704496
